<h1 align="center">The new best way to do CSS</h1>

## About

with the evolution of css, several tools emerged to help us in the development of applications, for example:

- Sass
- Less
- BEM CSS

But, currently we have the concept of CSS in JS, where we can create our styles in javascript files. This can brig us some advantages, for example:

- Reusability
- Dynamic functionally
- Local scope

And some technologies that stand out are:

- Styled Components
- Stitches
- Emotion
- Aphrodite

We talked a little about the evolution of CSS, there is only one thing missing: **tailwind CSS**

The Tailwind is being used by several companies, and why is very simple: **rapid development and productivity**

Because tailwind gives us a series of utility classes to apply our styles, so we don't waste time thinking about what to name an element. Then tailwind can be a great tool to use in your projects

## Demo

Opps! I forgot one thing, you can see a demo of a Button component using the technologies I mentioned.
